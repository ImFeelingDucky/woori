# Setting up the developer environment
* Install Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)
* Install yarn package manager (https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)
* Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    $ yarn
    ```
* Then, start the server with:
    ```bash
    $ nodejs app.js
    ```
    or, if that doesn't work,
    ```bash
    $ node app.js
    ```
* The website will be served at either `localhost:3000` or `localhost:8080`

# Working on the website
Once the developer environment is set up, you can start working on the site.

There are only two files to work on: `index.html` and `style.css`.
